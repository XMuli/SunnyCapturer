## v2.4

> 2024.12.02

**Changelog:**

- special thanks to @thiagodalsoto for providing Brazilian Portuguese translations
- Additional bug fixes and experience improvements. 

**Q&A:**

**Linux / Mac**

- **Q1: Linux won't run after installing a new version?**  
  Uninstall Sunny version 1.x or earlier, and try removing old configuration files `  rm -rf ~/.config/Sunny/*`


- **Q2: On Ubuntu 24.04, screenshots capture a white desktop. Why?**  
  To support more Linux distributions, Sunny 1-2.x currently supports only `x11` and does not support `Wayland` (Ubuntu's default). Switch to `x11` with the following steps (details in [#55](https://github.com/XMuli/SunnyCapturer/issues/55):  
  
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
  # Uncomment the line: WaylandEnable=false, then save the file.
  sudo systemctl restart gdm3  # Reboot the system
  ```
  
- **Q3: How can I use Sunny on non-Debian-based distributions?**  
  Please download and use the `sunny_x64.AppImage` package. For a list of supported Linux distributions, refer to [supportp_platform](https://sunny.xmuli.tech/article/supportp_platform.html).

- **Q4: How can I download Sunny for ARM and LOONGSON chips?**  
  You can download [v1.6.2](https://github.com/XMuli/SunnyCapturer/releases/tag/v1.6.2). When build machines become available, version 2.x will also be uploaded.

- **Q5: Why can‚Äôt Sunny run on my Mac?**  
  Currently, Sunny supports only Intel-based Macs and does not support M-series chips.

- ps: The next version is expected to support Mac's M-series chips and the Linux Wayland architecture.



**Offline OCR (CPU & GPU)**

> Extract text from images using a local offline engine.

- No registration or key input required.  
- Fully offline, with all processing done locally.  
- Supports both CPU and GPU modes:
  - **CPU Version**: Highly compatible, uses less memory, processes single images quickly but is slower for batch processing (recommended for general users).
  - **GPU Version**: Supports NVIDIA GPUs, uses more memory, but processes batch images significantly faster (1/2 to 1/3 the time of the CPU version, recommended for advanced users with NVIDIA cards).
- Only supports 64-bit Windows systems. Both versions handle single and batch image recognition. Simply drag and drop images into the window.
