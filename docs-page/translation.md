The corresponding `*.ts` translation files can be found at [translations](https://github.com/SunnyCapturer/translations). Once the translation is complete, please submit a pull request (PR).

It is recommended to download [Qt Linguist](https://github.com/lelegard/qtlinguist-installers/releases) to open and translate the `.ts` files. The README provides a detailed guide.

If you need any help or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me in any comment section.
